# Sokoban

A version of the game Sokoban in which a player pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. In this version there are targets for the crates and patches of ice which cause the player and boxes to slide as well as black holes that result in the game ending if the user walks into them. The user controls their movement via arrow keys and can undo moves by clicking the "u" key. The game keeps track of the number of moves a player has made and displays a "Game Won" or "Game Over" scene at the end to depict the ending state of the game.
