The sequence above can be shown to contain the value 0
infinitely many times. Use this fact, and the definition of the sequence, 
to show that there is no maximum value for the sequence.

If there are infinitely many zeros the sequence must also have an infinitely high maximum value.
Since the next value in the sequence is derived from the most recent occurrence of the previous value.
If there are infinitely many zeroes eventually the most recent index of the previous zero will have to be 
infinitely large. However the following term will then zero as the infinitely large term will not have appeared
before and so the next term after zero will be infinitely large + 1. This trend will continue and perpetuate
itself causing the sequence to increasing indefinitely over time and therefore there is no maximum value.

The sequence will increase over time and if the sequence goes on forever there is no one maximum value.




Suppose n is the number of elements in the sequence.

Suppose the sequence did have a maximum value, lets call the value m. If m were the maximum this means
there would be no new numbers after m. However, if m were truly the maximum that means m would not have appeared
in the sequence so far because it represents the most recent index of the previous term. Therefore, the term following m
would be 0 as it has not yet appeared in the sequence. Now lets think about the next term, following zero. 

If a maximum value is followed by a zero and there are infinitely many zeroes there must be infinitely many
maximum values therefore there is no one maximum value for the whole sequence.

zero follows every new value that appears in the sequence. if we have max m that means the last n - m 
indices of the sequence hold the complete history from that point on. the distinct values preceding a zero 
will trend towards in infinity over time because if there are infinitely many zeroes there are infinitely
many distinct values 









For a given value ùëÅ, give a formula for the earliest index where ùëÅ could possibly appear. 
Give another formula for the largest possible index before you must have seen a value of at least ùëÅ.
